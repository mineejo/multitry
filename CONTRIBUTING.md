## Commit

The [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) `v1.0.0` specification is a lightweight
convention on top of commit messages.

The commit message should be structured as follows:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```
